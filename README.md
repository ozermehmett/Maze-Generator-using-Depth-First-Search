# Maze-Generator-using-Depth-First-Search
This is a Python script that generates a randomized maze using a depth-first search algorithm.

## Description
This script generates a maze by carving out passages and walls using a depth-first search algorithm. The maze is represented as a 2D list, where walls are denoted by '1' and passages by '0'. The maze is created with a random starting and ending point on the top and bottom boundaries respectively.

## How it Works
1. The script starts with a grid of walls.
2. Random starting and ending points are selected on the top and bottom boundaries.
3. The depth-first search algorithm carves passages by randomly selecting a direction to move in.
4. The algorithm continues until all possible directions are exhausted.
5. The resulting maze is printed to the console.

## Usage
To generate and visualize the maze, simply run the `maze_generator.py` script using Python:
